# SpeechVault

![SpeechVault](speech-vault2.png)


## Description
SpeechVault is an AI-powered resource hub designed for speech pathologists working with middle and high school students on social communication skills. The platform centralizes therapy resources (PDFs, videos, activities) and uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to enable intelligent conversations with uploaded materials, while generating unlimited conversation starters, role-play scenarios, and text message simulations.
